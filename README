TAllTom - AllTom on Thin
An exercise in building a small web site on Thin itself.

Please let me know if you use this! :)

- A few gems are required: activerecord, feed_tools, thin, haml, and
  probably some others.
- Load schema.sql into a database supported by ActiveRecord. The SQL
  comes from MySQL, but uses nothing special, so it should load into
  other database servers with little effort.
- Move database.yml.example to database.yml and update it with
  information on how to connect to the database you configured.
- Start the server by running  ./alltom  . That will start an HTTP
  server on port 8000 (configured at the bottom of the script).

The "post" script is designed to be used as the login shell for an
account that is only used for changing the content of the site. It
allows for simple operations like adding/editing/deleting pages,
creating new revisions of pages, adding site news, etc. Install it by
setting up such an account, configuring the script as its shell (easiest
way is by editing /etc/passwd), and attempting to log in as that user
over SSH. The available arguments will be displayed.
